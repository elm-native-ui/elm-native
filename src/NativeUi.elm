{-| A node in the virtual View Tree that forms the basis of the UI for your app.
-}
type NativeUi
  = VNode String (List Property) (List NativeUi)
  | VString String


{-| `NativeUi` nodes take a List of Properties (or "props") to specify their behavior and presentation.
Most Properties can be represented as Json values, and you should always try to do so if possible.
If you must use a property that can't be encoded as Json, the NativeProperty tag can be used
to attach an opaque `NativeValue`.
-}
type Property
  = JsonProperty String Json.Decode.Value
  | NativeProperty String NativeValue


{-| An opaque value that is backed by a Native javascript value.
This is used to attach event handlers to `NativeUi` nodes, since functions can't be encoded
as Json values.

Try not to use `NativeValue` if you can avoid it, since the compiler can't help you
catch any mistakes that might lead to runtime errors.
-}
type NativeValue
  = NativeValue


{-| Create a `NativeUi` node with the given `tagName`, a list of properties,
and a list of child `NativeUi` nodes.

The `tagName` will be used to look up a React Component class with the same name,
so e.g. `node "View"` will render a React Native `View` component.
-}
node : String -> List Property -> List NativeUi -> NativeUi
node tagName props children =
  VNode tagName props children


{-| Just turn a plain text string into a `NativeUi` node, so that you can add it
as a child of another node.

    text
      [ style
        [ Style.fontSize 20
        , Style.color "blue"
        ]
      ]
      [ string "Hello World!" ]
-}
string : String -> NativeUi
string =
  VString


{-| Create a React Native `View` element with the given properties and children.

`View` is the fundamental building block of React Native's UI component system.
It represents a rectangle on the screen, and is commonly used as a container for
other UI elements, similar to a `div` in HTML.
-}
view : List Property -> List NativeUi -> NativeUi
view =
  VNode "View"


{-| Create a React Native `Text` element.

`Text` elements let you add styles, event handlers, and other React Native properties to
text strings.  They can be nested, for example, if you want part of a string to be bold:

    text
      [ onPress address SayHello ]
      [ string "This text has default styling, but "
      , text
          [ style [ Style.fontWeight "bold" ] ]
          [ string "this is BOLD!" ]
      ]

Since the `onPress` handler is attached to the outer `text` element, you can press on
either the bold or unstyled text to `SayHello`.
-}
text : List Property -> List NativeUi -> NativeUi
text =
  VNode "Text"


{-| Create a React Native `Text` element.
-}
textInput : List Property -> List NativeUi -> NativeUi
textInput =
  VNode "TextInput"


{-| Create a React Native `Image` element.

Use these for displaying images from the web, or (soon!) images that are bundled
in with your app.

To tell the image element what to render, you need to give it an `imageSource` property
with the URI of the image.

Unlike the HTML `image` tag, a React Native `Image` element will not resize to fit its contents,
so you must provide some way for the layout engine to determine the size,
or else it won't show up onscreen.  You can either set an explicit `width` and `height` in the
`style` property, or you can use flexbox to have the image size itself proportionally to its
container.

An image element can have children, in which case it acts similarly to the `background-image`
CSS property on the web:

    image
      [ imageSource "http://example.com/fuzzy_kitten.png"
      , style
        [ Style.width 100
        , Style.height 100
        , Style.alignItems "center"
        ]
      ]
      [ text
          [ style [ Style.fontSize 30 ] ]
          [ string "This text will be rendered inside the image.  It's meme time!" ]
      ]
-}
image : List Property -> List NativeUi -> NativeUi
image =
  VNode "Image"



-- Properties


{-| Attach arbitrary properties to `NativeUi` nodes.

Use this for properties that can be represented as Json values.
-}
property : String -> Json.Decode.Value -> Property
property name value =
  JsonProperty name value


{-| Turns a String URI into the "source" property for an image element.
-}
imageSource : String -> Property
imageSource uri =
  Json.Encode.object [ ( "uri", Json.Encode.string uri ) ]
    |> property "source"


{-| Turns a list of `Style`s into a property you can attach to a `NativeUi` node.
-}
style : List Style.Style -> Property
style styles =
  Style.encode styles
    |> property "style"

value : String -> Property
value val =
  JsonProperty "value" (Json.Encode.string val)

-- Events


nativeEventHandler : Json.Decode.Decoder a -> (a -> Signal.Message) -> NativeValue
nativeEventHandler =
  Native.NativeUi.nativeEventHandler


on : String -> Json.Decode.Decoder a -> (a -> Signal.Message) -> Property
on name decoder toMessage =
  let
    fullName =
      "on" ++ name

    handler =
      nativeEventHandler decoder toMessage
  in
    NativeProperty fullName handler


{-| Binds an event handler into the `onPress` event.
-}
onPress : Signal.Address a -> a -> Property
onPress address msg =
  on "Press" Json.Decode.value (\_ -> Signal.message address msg)
